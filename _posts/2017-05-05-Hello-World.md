Hi,
This is my first blog post, many more will follow. Here I will post about progress of my project along with some random posts about life,
politics, tutorial or book reviews. You might ask what new does this blog add to already existing content on internet. Well honest answer
is I don't know, this is my first attempt at writing other than mandatory academic papers. There are two reasons why I have started this
blog. First I have been selected in GSoC and the programme requires to write blog. Secondly I follow lots of blogs on various topics on
quora/medium etc regularly so I always thought about writing a blog but never started one. So after my selection in GSoC first thing I
did was to set up a blog.

One month back when I submitted my proposal for GSoC to Matplotlib, NumFocus I never thought that I will be accepted. All this time I
felt my proposal wasn't good enough. Maybe it wasn't or maybe it was but to my ashtonishment my mentors showed confidence in me and
selected me. It is going to be a challenging task for sure. Hoping to have lots of fun and looking forward to learn many new things this
summer. 

More on my journey in open source in next post.
