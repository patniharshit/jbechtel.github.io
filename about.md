Hi, I am Harshit Patni from Indore, India. A third year undergrad at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad majoring in Computer Science. This summer I will be working as Google Summer of Code student with NumFocus (Matplotlib). 

Apart from coding, I am an avid reader and follower of Indian politics. Anytime you can find me sitting in a corner and reading some ebook on my mobile. I also enjoy playing chess and Counter Strike although people tell me I am just a noob in both :D
